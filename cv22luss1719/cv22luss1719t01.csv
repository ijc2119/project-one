Note: Coverage ratios were calculated by taking the sum of the intermediate or final weights over the 3-year period from 2017 to 2019. This sum was divided by the total number of occupied housing units from the 2018 American Community Survey 1-year estimates. The U.S. Census Bureau reviewed this data product for unauthorized disclosure of confidential information and approved the disclosure avoidance practices applied to this release (CBDRB-FY20-307). ,,,
a/Intermediate weights are sampling base weights adjusted for nonresponse but not adjusted to match independent population totals.,,,
